<p align="center" class="fontTitle">Welcome to the COCO 2017 Detection Challenge!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/detections-challenge2015.png"/></p>

<p class="fontTitle">1. Overview</p>
<p>The COCO 2017 Detection Challenge is designed to push the state of the art in object detection forward. Teams are encouraged to compete in either (or both) of two object detection challenges: using bounding box output or object segmentation output.  For full details of this task please see the <a href="#detections-eval">detection evaluation</a> page.</p>
<p>This challenge is part of the <a href="https://places-coco2017.github.io/">Joint COCO and Places Recognition Challenge Workshop</a> at ICCV 2017. For further details about the joint workshop please visit the workshop website. Participants are encouraged to participate in both the COCO and Places challenges. Please also see the concurrent COCO 2017 <a href="#stuff-challenge2017">Stuff</a> and <a href="#keypoints-challenge2017">Keypoint</a> Challenges.</p>
<p>The COCO train, validation, and test sets, containing more than 200,000 images and 80 object categories, are available on the <a href="#download">download</a> page. All object instances are annotated with a detailed segmentation mask. Annotations on the training and validation sets (with over 500,000 object instances segmented) are publicly available.</p>
<p>This is the third COCO detection challenge and it generally follows the <a href="#detections-challenge2016">COCO 2016 Detection Challenge</a>. In particular, the same overall data and metrics are being used for this year's challenge. The mains differences are that now <b>(1) the test set only contains two splits: test-dev and test-challenge,</b> and <b>(2) the train/val sets are arranged differently</b>. Please see the <a href="#download">download</a> and <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> pages for details about the setup for the 2017 data and test splits.</p>

<p class="fontTitle">5. Challenge Guidelines</p>
<p>The <a href="#detections-eval">detection evaluation</a> page lists detailed information regarding how submissions will be scored and gives instructions for submitting results to the evaluation server. The test set is divided into two splits: test-dev and test-challenge. Test-dev is as the default test set for testing under general circumstances and is used to maintain a public <a href="#detections-leaderboard">leaderboard</a> that is updated upon submission. Test-challenge is used for the workshop competition; results will be revealed during the workshop at ICCV 2017. Competitors are recommended but not restricted to train their algorithms on COCO 2017 train and val sets. The <a href="#download">download</a> page has links to all 2017 data. Please specify any and all external data used for training in the "method description" when uploading results to the evaluation server. A more thorough explanation of all these details is available on the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> page, please be sure to review it carefully prior to participating. By the challenge deadline, results must be submitted to the <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/5181" target="_blank">detection evaluation server</a>. Competitors' algorithms will be evaluated according to the metrics described on the <a href="#detections-eval">evaluation</a> page. Challenge participants with the most successful and innovative methods will be invited to present.</p>

<p class="fontTitle">6. Tools and Instructions</p>
<p>We provide extensive API support for the COCO images, annotations, and evaluation code. To download the COCO API, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/pdollar/coco">GitHub repository</a>. For an overview of how to use the API, please visit the <a href="#download">download</a> page and consult the sections entitled COCO API and MASK API.</p>
<p>Due to the large size of COCO and the complexity of this challenge, the process of competing in this challenge may not seem simple. To help, we provide explanations and instructions for each step of the process on the <a href="#download">download</a>, <a href="#format">format</a>, <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a>, and <a href="#detection-eval">evaluation</a> pages. For additional questions, please contact <a href="mailto:cocodataset@outlook.com">cocodataset@outlook.com</a>.</p>
